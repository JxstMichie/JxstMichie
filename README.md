# History
I started in 2017 with python 2 with a "Python book for dumbies" and moved on to modding GameBoy Advance Games , I moved to C# when I started playing modern vidoe games as they all used C# and Unity and started making mods for them like Lethal Company (UNity & C#) and Terraria (C#). I moved to Rec Room (C# and Unity) which had their own visual script like system and made a game called "Secret Santa" Which got fairly successful , in its first month it got 80k visits. I moved back to Python 3 and am activley pursueing Computer Science
